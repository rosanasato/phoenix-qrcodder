 Read, write, modify, and save; do whatever you want with your QR code.

## What it does:\
- Reads a QR Code picture and displays the formatted information and raw value
- Allows you to edit the raw value
- Allows you to generate a new QR Code with the edited raw value
- Copies the raw value to the clipboard

## What I intend to do:\
- Option to read the QR Code directly from the camera
- Save or export the generated QR Code
